  <h2>Solid Wasteâ€”Sources, Toxicity, and Their Consequences to Human Health</h2>

  <h2>Classification of solid waste components</h2>
  <p>Domestic waste is one of the most important components of municipal waste. Domestic wastes include food waste, paper, glass,
     metals, plastics, textiles, etc. A large part of domestic wastes consists of plant and animal waste such as vegetables, fruit peel,
      bone and meat waste, and chicken and fish waste, which are considered as wet wastes. Paper and cardboard, waste newspapers,
       books, notebooks, and wrapping paper also make up another large portion of the wastes. Plastics, disposable dishes, toys, 
       and metal and glass cans are another part of domestic wastes. Different definitions and classifications have been presented in 
       various publications and books to describe the components of municipal solid waste. The definitions presented in Table 11.2 can
        be used as a guide for identifying municipal solid waste components (Suthar & Singh, 2015).</p></div>

  <h2>Water Quality and Sustainability</h2>
  <h4>P. Wang, C. Wang, in Comprehensive Water Quality and Purification, 2014</h4>
  <h2>Domestic waste collection and disposal</h2>
  <p>Domestic waste has become one of the most significant causes of severe damage to the rural eco-environment because of 
    the large amounts of waste discharged and improper disposal (Wang and Lu, 2006). In order to eliminate contaminations from 
    domestic waste, a waste management system including waste collection, transportation, and treatment have been established. 
    First, a waste treatment and disposal plan was made to restrict improper disposal and clean up of existing piles of waste 
    near canals, roads, and houses. Second, a domestic waste treatment collection network, including certain numbers of waste 
    collection sites and transfer stations, was built in big villages and counties. Third, waste reclamation technologies, 
    such as methane fermentation, composting, and the production of compound fertilizers, were developed and applied.</p>
